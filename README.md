## Requirements

Unity Version: 5.5.0 or higher

Editor Version: Windows, MacOS, Linux

## Installation

Place the BgTools folder somewhere in your project. It's not relevant where it's located, the plugin will find all of its files by itself.

## Usage

The entry to open the _Player Preferences Editor_ is located in the menubar at Tools/BG Tools/Player Preferences Editor. It's a standard dockable window, so place it wherever it helps to be productive.
