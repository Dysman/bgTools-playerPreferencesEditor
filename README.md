## Requirements

Unity Version: 2017.4.3 (LTS) or higher

Editor Version: Windows, MacOS, Linux

## Installation

Place the BgTools folder somewhere in your project. It's not relevant where it's located, the plugin will find all of its files by itself.

## Usage

The entry to open the _Player Preferences Editor_ is located in the menubar at Tools/BG Tools/Player Preferences Editor. It's a standard dockable window, so place it wherever it helps to be productive.
Into the settings it's possible to activate the 'monitoring of player preference changes'. This will detect changes and refresh the entries automatically to keep the view up-to-date.
